        <li>Which song did you find the hardest to watch/listen to?</li>
        <li>Some people have described the film as being in the ‘depressioncore’ genre. The character talks about struggles with anxiety and depression, that have impacted his career, and lead to a career break. What did you think of the portrayal of mental health in the film?</li>
        <li>The Microsoft Inclusive Design principles talk about access needs in terms of temporary vs situational vs permanent. How much of the character's mental health is situational vs permanent? Does mental health fit into that model?</li>

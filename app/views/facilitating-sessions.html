        Facilitating Accessibility Book Club Sessions
      </h1>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before the session</h2>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Identify what platform works best for your group - in person, on Teams, Zoom, etc</li>
        <li>If the event is online, consider if things like captions can be turned on, in the meeting</li>
        <li>If the event is in person, consider the accessibiilty of the physical location you've chosen</li>
        <li>Send across a link to a code of conducts to participants, in advance</li>
        <li>Share the questions you'll be discussing, so people can have a think about them in advance</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">In the session</h2>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Introductions</h3>
      <p>Start off by inviting people to share:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>their name</li>
        <li>their job title</li>
        <li>optionally, their pronouns</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The session facilitator would ideally be the one to nominate who goes next, after an introduction is finished.</p>

      <p>Introducing yourself to a group of new people can sometimes be a little intimidating or stressful, so this removes
        the added pressure of having to remember who's already gone. It also means that late joiners don't get put in a
        position where
        they have to pick, given they don't know who went before they joined.</p>


      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Setting ground rules</h3>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Go over the key points in your code of conduct verbally (don't assume everyone has had time to read it beforehand)
        </li>
        <li>Discuss how to have the discussion - suggest that if people want to say something, raise their hand (either
          physically, or using functionality in the app you're having the conversation in)</li>
        <li>Mistakes happen. <a href="http://teachpaperless.blogspot.com/2011/06/oops-ouch.html">Introduce 'oops, ouch'</a> -
          where you say 'oops' to communicate you said something by accident that you regret, or 'ouch' to communicate that
          something someone else has said has caused you discomfort</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Getting people talking</h3>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Invite people to spend 3 minutes thinking about the questions, on their own.</li>
        <li>Then, put people into groups of 2-4, so they can discuss their ideas in a smaller group.</li>
        <li>After 5-10 minutes, bring everyone back into the main space, and invite each group to share what they discussed.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The above is all based off of the [1-2-4-all concept in Liberating
        Structures](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/).</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Wrapping up</h3>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Thank people for attending, and for sharing their thoughts.</li>
        <li>Consider having a vote, to decide on what the group discusses next time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">After the session</h2>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Ask people to suggest somethign to discuss next time, with a timelimit for discussions</li>
        <li>Once this time has passed, run a poll with the suggestions in, again with a time limit for responses</li>
        <li>Run a poll to decide on the date and time for the next session</li>
        <li>Create the calendar holder for the next session</li>
      </ul>

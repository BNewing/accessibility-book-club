# Facilitating discussions

This is still in draft form, and is to be iterated on.

## Before the session
- Identify what platform works best for your group - in person, on Teams, Zoom, etc
- If the event is online, consider if things like captions can be turned on, in the meeting
- If the event is in person, consider the accessibiilty of the physical location you've chosen
- Send across a link to a code of conducts to participants, in advance
- Share the questions you'll be discussing, so people can have a think about them in advance

## In the session

### Introductions
Start off by inviting people to share their names, job roles, and optionally, pronouns.

The session facilitator would ideally be the one to nominate who goes next after an introduction is finished, as they can more easily keep track of who's not gone yet. 

This is because introducing yourself to a group of new people can sometimes be a little scary or stressful, so this removes the added pressure of having to remember who's already gone and who to nominate after you've finished doing that. 

It also means that late joiners don't get put in a position where they have to pick a next person, not knowing who went before they joined.

### Setting groundrules
- Go over the key points in your code of conduct verbally (don't assume everyone has had time to read it beforehand)
- Discuss how to have the discussion - suggest that if people want to say something, raise their hand (either physically, or using functionality in the app you're having the conversation in)
- [Introduce 'oops, ouch'](http://teachpaperless.blogspot.com/2011/06/oops-ouch.html) - where you say 'oops' for if you've said something by accident that you regret, or 'ouch' to communicate that something someone else has said has caused you discomfort

### Getting people talking
Invite people to spend 3 minutes thinking about the questions, on their own. 

In the session, first put people into groups of 2-4, so they can discuss their ideas in a smaller group.

After 5-10 minutes, bring everyone back into the main space, and invite each group to share what they discussed.

The above is all based off of the [1-2-4-all concept in Liberating Structures](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/).

### Wrapping up
Thank people for attending, and for sharing their thoughts.

Consider having a vote, to decide on what the group discusses next time.

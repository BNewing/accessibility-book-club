# Accessibility Book Club
Books and discussion guides for running an accessibility book club.

The intention is for this to become a structure to support running an accessibility book club.

It contains notes on how to facilitate discussions, that will be iterated on over time.

It also contains a list of books, films and podcasts, as suggestions for material for the sessions.

# Accessibility Book Club
Books and discussion guides for running an accessibility book club.

It contains notes on how to facilitate discussions, that will be iterated on over time. It also contains a list of books, films and podcasts, as suggestions for material for the sessions.

## Running this locally
This is built using the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs).

To get started:
1. Clone this down to your machine
2. Run 'npm install'
3. Run 'npm start'

## Contributing
I would love contributions to the reading list and discussion guides!

To add to those things, feel free to either raise PRs or issues, or [contact me on Twitter to make suggestions](https://twitter.com/WebDevBev/).

### Pushing changes
Heroku is set to automatically redeploy any time something changes on the main branch. So if you make a PR, once it's approved and merged in, it'll then make its way to the site.

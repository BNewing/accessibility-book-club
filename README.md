# Accessibility Book Club
Books and discussion guides for running an accessibility book club.

It contains notes on how to facilitate discussions, that will be iterated on over time. It also contains a list of books, films and podcasts, as suggestions for material for the sessions.

## Contributing
I would love contributions to the reading list and discussion guides! 

To add to those things, feel free to either raise PRs or issues, or [contact me on Twitter to make suggestions](https://twitter.com/WebDevBev/).
